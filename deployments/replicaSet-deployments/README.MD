## Overview

Here is an example of a Kubernetes manifest file for a Replica Set deployment:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: example-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: example-image
```

This manifest file creates a Replica Set with three replicas of a pod running the "example-image" image. The Replica Set is named "example-rs" and it will select pods with the label "app: example" to manage.

The Replica Set will ensure that there are always three replicas of the pod running in the cluster, even if one or more of the pods fail. It will automatically create new replicas to replace any failed pods.

To deploy this Replica Set on a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool:

```
kubectl apply -f example-rs.yaml
```

You can use the kubectl command to view the status of the Replica Set and the pods it manages:

```
kubectl get replicasets
kubectl get pods
```

## When to Use
A Replica Set is a good choice for applications that need to scale horizontally and can tolerate some level of pod failure. For even more advanced deployment features, such as rolling updates and rollbacks, you can use a Deployment controller instead of a Replica Set.
