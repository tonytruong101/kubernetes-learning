## Overview
This configuration file creates a deployment called react-app that runs three replicas of a container image named my-react-app:latest, which should include the React application and its dependencies. The application will listen on port 8080 and will be set to the production environment.

The configuration file also creates a service called react-app that exposes the deployment to external traffic. The service is of type LoadBalancer, which means that it will create an external load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across the replicas of the React application.

You can customize the configuration file to specify the desired number of replicas, the resources that the React application requires, and any additional environment variables or configuration options. You can also set up service discovery and networking to expose the React application to other applications in the cluster.
