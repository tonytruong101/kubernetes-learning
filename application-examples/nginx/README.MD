## Overview
A Kubernetes deployment is a resource that manages a replicated application, such as a web server or a database. It ensures that the desired number of replicas of the application are running and available at all times, and provides features such as rolling updates, rollbacks, and self-healing.

To create a deployment in Kubernetes, you will need to define a configuration file (in YAML format) that specifies the details of the deployment, such as the number of replicas, the container image to use, and the resources that the application requires.
