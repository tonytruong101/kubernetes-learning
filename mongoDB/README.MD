## Overview

To deploy a MongoDB database to Kubernetes, you will need to create a container image that includes the MongoDB server software and configure the database. An example of a MongoDB database configuration can be found in this repo.

This configuration file creates a deployment called mongodb that runs a single replica of the mongo:4.4 container image, which includes the MongoDB server software. The database will listen on port 27017 and will use persistent storage to store data.

You can customize the configuration file to specify the desired number of replicas, the resources that the MongoDB server requires, and any additional environment variables or configuration options. You can also set up service discovery and networking to expose the MongoDB server to other applications in the cluster.

Once you have created the deployment configuration file, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to deploy the MongoDB database to your Kubernetes cluster.
