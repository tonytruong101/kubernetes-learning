## Overview
This configuration file creates a deployment called rails-app that runs three replicas of a container image named my-rails-app:latest, which should include the Ruby on Rails application and its dependencies. The application will listen on port 3000 and will be set to the production environment.

The configuration file also creates a service called rails-app that exposes the deployment to external traffic. The service is of type LoadBalancer, which means that it will create an external load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across the replicas of the Ruby on Rails application.

You can customize the configuration file to specify the desired number of replicas, the resources that the Ruby on Rails application requires, and any additional environment variables or configuration options. You can also set up service discovery and networking to expose the Ruby on Rails application to other applications in the cluster.

Once you have created the configuration file, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to create the deployment and the service in your Kubernetes cluster. For example, you can use the following command to create the resources:

```
kubectl apply -f rails-app.yaml
```
