## Overview
This configuration file creates a deployment called nextjs-app that runs three replicas of a container image named my-nextjs-app:latest, which should include the Next.js application and its dependencies. The application will listen on port 3000.

The configuration file also creates a service called nextjs-app that exposes the deployment to external traffic. The service is of type LoadBalancer, which means that it will create an external load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across the replicas of the Next.js application.

You can customize the configuration file to specify the desired number of replicas, the resources that the Next.js application requires, and any additional environment variables or configuration options. You can also set up service discovery and networking to expose the Next.js application to other applications in the cluster.
