## Technical Overview

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines, called nodes, that are used to run containerized applications. The cluster is managed by a group of components called the control plane, which consists of the API server, etcd, and the scheduler.

The API server is the central way to interact with the cluster, and it exposes the Kubernetes API. The etcd database stores the cluster's persistent data. The scheduler is responsible for placing pods (the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes) onto nodes in the cluster.

There are two types of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster: master nodes and worker nodes. Master nodes are responsible for managing the cluster, and worker nodes are responsible for running the applications. Master nodes host the control plane components and etcd, and worker nodes host the pods that run the applications.

**Here are some key concepts to understand when it comes to Kubernetes clusters**:

- **Cluster**: A set of machines that are used to run containerized applications.
- **Node**: A machine in a Kubernetes cluster that runs pods and is managed by the master components. There are two types of nodes: master nodes and worker nodes.
- **Master node**: A node that is responsible for managing the cluster. It hosts the control plane components and etcd.
- **Worker node**: A node that is responsible for running the applications. It hosts the pods that run the applications.
- **Control plane**: The group of components that manage the cluster. It consists of the API server, etcd, and the scheduler.
- **API server**: The central way to interact with the cluster, exposing the Kubernetes API.
- **etcd**: A database that stores the cluster's persistent data.
- **Scheduler**: Responsible for placing pods onto nodes in the cluster.
