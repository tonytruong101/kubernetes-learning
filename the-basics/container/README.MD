## Technical Overview
In Kubernetes, a container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Containers are a key component of Kubernetes and are used to host the applications that run in a cluster. They are run within pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Pods contain one or more containers, and the containers in a pod share the same network namespace, meaning they can all communicate with each other using localhost.

Containers are created from container images, which are executable packages that include everything needed to run the application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. Container images are built using a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains the instructions for building the image.

**Here are some basic concepts related to containers in Kubernetes**:

- **Container image**: A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything an application needs to run, including the application code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Container images are stored in a registry, such as Docker Hub, and can be pulled and run on any system that has a container runtime installed.

- **Container runtime**: A container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers in a Kubernetes cluster. The container runtime is responsible for pulling the container images, starting the containers, and managing their lifecycle.

- **Container resources**: Containers have resource limits and constraints that specify the maximum amount of CPU, memory, and other resources that the container is allowed to consume. Resource limits and constraints are used to ensure that containers do not interfere with each other and do not exceed their allocated resources.

- **Container environment variables**: Containers can be configured with environment variables that are used to pass configuration information to the application code. Environment variables can be set in the container image or at runtime using a Kubernetes manifest file.

- **Container volumes**: Containers can mount volumes that provide persistent storage for the container. Volumes can be used to store data that needs to be preserved across container restarts or to share data between containers.

- **Container ports**: Containers expose one or more ports that can be accessed from outside the container. Containers can be configured to listen on a specific port or to use a dynamic port.

- **Container networking**: Containers are connected to a network in the cluster and are given a unique network identity. Containers can communicate with each other and with external clients using standard network protocols.


**Here are some key concepts to understand when it comes to containers in Kubernetes:**

- **Container**: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- **Container image**: An executable package that includes everything needed to run the application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains the instructions for building a container image.
- **Container runtime**: The software responsible for pulling container images, starting and stopping containers, and managing their lifecycle.
