## Technical Overview
In Kubernetes, a container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Containers are a key component of Kubernetes and are used to host the applications that run in a cluster. They are run within pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Pods contain one or more containers, and the containers in a pod share the same network namespace, meaning they can all communicate with each other using localhost.

Containers are created from container images, which are executable packages that include everything needed to run the application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. Container images are built using a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains the instructions for building the image.

**Here are some key concepts to understand when it comes to containers in Kubernetes:**

- **Container**: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- **Container image**: An executable package that includes everything needed to run the application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains the instructions for building a container image.
- **Container runtime**: The software responsible for pulling container images, starting and stopping containers, and managing their lifecycle.
