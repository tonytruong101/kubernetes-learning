## Technical Overview

A container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers in a Kubernetes cluster. The container runtime is responsible for pulling the container images, starting the containers, and managing their lifecycle.

**Here is a technical overview of container runtimes in Kubernetes**:

- The container runtime is responsible for starting and stopping the containers in the pods. It is also responsible for monitoring the health of the containers and restarting them if they fail.
- The container runtime is responsible for pulling the images for the containers and storing them locally. It is also responsible for keeping the images up to date and removing stale images.
- The container runtime is responsible for creating and destroying the containers as needed. It is also responsible for managing the resources of the containers, such as CPU and memory, and enforcing resource limits and constraints.
- The container runtime exposes a RESTful API that can be used to query the status of the containers and to perform other operations on them.
- The container runtime is responsible for networking the containers and providing them with access to the external network. It is also responsible for providing the containers with a unique network identity and isolation from each other.
- The container runtime is responsible for storing the data generated by the containers. It is also responsible for mounting the volumes associated with the pods and making them available to the containers.
- The container runtime is responsible for providing the containers with access to the host system, such as the filesystem and system resources. It is also responsible for isolating the containers from each other and from the host system.

There are several container runtime options available for use in Kubernetes, including Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
