## Technical Overview
The kubelet is a critical component in a Kubernetes cluster that runs on each node and is responsible for managing the pods on the node. The kubelet works closely with the Kubernetes master to ensure that the desired state of the pods on the node is maintained.

**Here is a technical overview of the kubelet**:

- The kubelet is the primary node-level component in a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for managing the pods on the node and ensuring that they are running in the desired state.
- The kubelet communicates with the Kubernetes master to get the desired state of the pods on the node and to report the current state of the pods.
- The kubelet is responsible for starting and stopping the containers in the pods, as well as performing rolling updates and rollbacks when required.
- The kubelet is responsible for monitoring the health of the pods and containers on the node and restarting them if they fail.
- The kubelet uses the container runtime (such as Docker or containerd) to run the containers in the pods. It is responsible for pulling the images for the containers and starting the containers in the appropriate runtime.
- The kubelet exposes a RESTful API that can be used to query the status of the pods and containers on the node and to perform other operations on the node.
- The kubelet is responsible for mounting the volumes associated with the pods on the node and making them available to the containers in the pods.
- The kubelet is responsible for enforcing the resource limits and constraints for the pods on the node. It ensures that the pods do not exceed their allocated resources and do not interfere with each other.

The kubelet plays a critical role in the operation of a Kubernetes cluster and is an essential component of the Kubernetes control
