## Technical Overview
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node is a worker machine that runs pods and is managed by the master components. Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and they contain one or more containers.

A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent that runs on the node and communicates with the Kubernetes control plane. The Kubelet works with the container runtime (such as Docker or containerd) to run the containers in a pod.

Nodes also have a container runtime, which is responsible for pulling container images, starting and stopping containers, and managing their lifecycle.

In addition to running pods, nodes can also host additional components such as a proxy and a kubelet service. The proxy (also called kube-proxy) is a network proxy that runs on each node and implements part of the Kubernetes networking model. It allows for communication between pods and external services. The kubelet service is responsible for communicating with the Kubernetes API server and syncing the node's desired state with the actual state.

**Here are some key concepts to understand when it comes to nodes in a Kubernetes cluster**:

- **Kubelet**: The agent that runs on each node and communicates with the control plane. It works with the container runtime to run the containers in a pod.
- **Container runtime**: The software responsible for pulling container images, starting and stopping containers, and managing their lifecycle.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- **Proxy (kube-proxy)**: A network proxy that runs on each node and implements part of the Kubernetes networking model, allowing for communication between pods and external services.
- **Kubelet service**: Responsible for communicating with the Kubernetes API server and syncing the node's desired state with the actual state.
