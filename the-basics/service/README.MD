## Technical Overview

In Kubernetes, a service is a resource that abstracts a set of pods and provides a stable endpoint for accessing them. It can be used to load balance traffic to the pods and can be accessed using a DNS name or a stable IP address.

There are different types of services in Kubernetes, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some of the most common types:

- **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. It is only reachable from within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a specific port on each node in the cluster. It can be accessed from outside the cluster using the node's IP address and the specified port.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **ExternalName**: Maps the service to the contents of the externalName field in the service's spec. No proxying is involved. This type of service is useful for connecting to external services.
