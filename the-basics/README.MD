## Overview

Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a platform-agnostic way to deploy and run applications in a consistent and reliable manner across different environments.

**Here are some basic concepts in Kubernetes**:

**Node**: A node is a physical or virtual machine that runs one or more Kubernetes pods. A node is managed by a Kubernetes cluster and is responsible for running the containers in the pods.

**Pod**: A pod is the basic execution unit in Kubernetes. It is a logical host for one or more containers that are scheduled to run on the same node. Pods are ephemeral and can be created and deleted as needed.

**Container**: A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything an application needs to run, including the application code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Containers are isolated from each other and can be easily moved between environments.

**Cluster**: A cluster is a set of nodes that are managed by a Kubernetes master. The master is responsible for scheduling pods to nodes, monitoring the health of the nodes and pods, and responding to changes in the desired state of the system.

**Deployment**: A Deployment is a higher-level controller in Kubernetes that manages Replica Sets and provides additional features such as rolling updates and rollbacks. It is the recommended way to deploy applications on Kubernetes.

**Service**: A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. It is used to expose a set of pods to external clients or to other parts of the cluster.

These are just a few of the basic concepts in Kubernetes. There are many other concepts and features in Kubernetes that are beyond the scope of this summary.
